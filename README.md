`device-setup.py` was created specifically for Termux on emulated environments. We use auto-rejoin by @not.shiroo with an automated device setup including all necessary dependencies. [raw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/7Boxes/Externals/refs/heads/main/device-setup.py)
`roblox-status-dc-bot.py` works but API can mess up if you are in-game and on-website. [raw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/7Boxes/Externals/refs/heads/main/roblox-status-dc-bot.py)
